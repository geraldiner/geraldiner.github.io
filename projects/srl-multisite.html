            Dr. Shepherd brings his extensive 30-year research career to Hawai ªi
            with the aim of catering to its unique population. Upon arrival, he

                    getting settled and working on this website. As I was

                      When you first open the website, can the viewer understand
                      what ‚ÄúShepherd Research Lab‚Äù really means?

                      The turtle makes it interesting, but is it relevant?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      How can we highlight the research and projects even more,
                      eg. Breast Density Workshop, featured talks by members,
                      etc.?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      The long list of research projects could be overwhelming.
                      Is there a better way to present the SRL portfolio?

                    Now the site's been up for 2 years, and we've seen it do
                    exactly as Dr. Shepherd wanted.

                    However, knowing that the site was created in a rush, there
                    are still some things that could be improved.
